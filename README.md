🛰️ Space Habitats

Space Habitats is an interactive web application that explores how different types of habitats could support human life in space.
It lets users test habitat shapes — cylinders, toruses, and capsules — calculate volume, area, and estimated capacity, and even design 2D layouts with draggable and rotatable modules.

🚀 Objective

The project was created for the NASA Space Apps Challenge to make space engineering concepts more accessible and engaging.
It helps students visualize how geometry, structure, and comfort work together in space architecture.

🧠 What the project does

Calculates usable volume, floor area, and estimated population capacity.

Offers presets for different habitat types (cylinder, torus, capsule).

Generates an interactive 2D layout editor to organize rooms and modules.

Encourages learning about geometry, engineering, and life-support systems.

🧩 Technologies used

HTML — page structure and layout

CSS — visual style and responsive design

JavaScript (SVG) — real-time geometry calculations and graphics

💡 Next steps

Add 3D visualization for habitat shapes.

Include resource estimations (oxygen, water, energy).

Connect the 2D layout to the capacity calculator for full integration.
